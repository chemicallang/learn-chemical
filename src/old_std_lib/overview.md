### The Old Standard Library

Our standard library is not yet finished, that's why we refer to the current library as 'old'

The new standard library would be safe to use, using most features of the language, Currently

This standard library that is similar to C++ in naming is being used

To import this library use `import std` in the `chemical.mod` file

```
module main

import std
```
